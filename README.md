**MIND MENDER**

Our project **MIND BENDER** addresses Mental Health Issues and the need to be aware about it. During the lockdown and online era, mental breakdowns were very common. Both mental and physical health are essential for everyone. The project aims at helping people to get rid of their psychological problems by introspecting and understanding themselves through expert sessions, personalized counseling sessions, and curated blogs. It also focuses on building a community where like-minded people can socialise, share their experiences and problems, understand things better and prosper. Additionally, people can also get information about different mental health problems, tips, solutions, etc.

**HOW WE BUILT IT **

We used html, CSS, and Bootstrap for front end. We have different sections like blogs, health problems, and live sessions were users can register for them.   

**CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO**

We first started with react but then shifted to html, CSS as this was our first project working as a team and not everyone was on the same level. While working with CSS and Bootstrap together, we faced few problems which was solved after doing some research. Then while getting our project on github we faced problems to work as a team such as uploading the project and merging it together, as it was our first time working on a collaborative project.   

**BUILT WITH**

1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	Bootstrap
    
**WHATâ€™S NEXT FOR MIND MENDER**

Next we want to introduce a chat section where people can interact with each other and share their experiences. This would eventually create a community where people can easily talk about themselves. And users can also write and share their stories. Our future aim is to enhance user-interactivity, develop the backend part, make front-end even more appealing.
